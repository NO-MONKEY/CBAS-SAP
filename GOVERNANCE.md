# CBAS Governance Model

In order to successfully manage and align the different areas of contribution in the CBAS project, a governance structure has been created to clearly define:
- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- The different roles in the project
- Permissions that are given to each role
- Addressing conflict
- Project management committee (further committees will be introduced as the project advances)

## Roles

### Contributors

Anyone that enhances and contributes to the project in anyway is considered a contributor. (See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page on how to get involved in the different projects.)

#### Contributors Activities
 - Recommend improvements to the overall project
 - Submit pull requests and raise issues
 - Support and document on issues
 - Support users
 - Propose changes to the project through pull request, issues, or the listed [communication channels](README.md#Communication channels)
 - Participate in discussions

### Committers

Committers are assigned by the project leaders and are selected by showing their dedication to the project through ongoing engagement.

#### Committers Activities
- Review and merge pull requests
- Make direct changes to the project
- Support contributors and users
- Facilitate and participate in discussions
- Participate in the monthly team meetings

__Committers can be removed and assigned as contributors by the project leaders due to lack of engagement.__

## Conflict Resolution

All conflicts, issues, and disagreements towards a proposed change in the project will be handled by the project leaders until a committee has been formed.

Decision making will involve a proposal, a discussion, and finally a vote. The vote is conducted between project leaders and committers.

If either contributors or committers have proposed a change and no one explicitly opposes, the change will automatically be approved and applied.
