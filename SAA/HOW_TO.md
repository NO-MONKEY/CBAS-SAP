Required documents:
- Security_Aptitude_Analysis.xlsx
  - The Security_Aptitude_Analysis document provides the analysis of the assessments conducted within the organization

- SAA_Assessment.xlsx
  - The assessment required to be filled

- Survey.xlsx
  - This document will be used to combine all assessment results

**"The more the survey takers are, the better the results and analysis become to understand the gap areas within your organization"**

To get started, download a copy of the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_, _"SAA_Assessment"_ and _"Survey"_ documents from the [Analysis folder](https://github.com/NO-MONKEY/CBAS/tree/master/Analysis)

Assessment requirements:
- Each assessment must uniquely be identified by an ID number (i.e. 1,2,3...)

- The _"Data"_ sheet inside the assessment should be exported
to the generic file _"Survey.xlsx"_.

- Once you have copied or exported the data to the _"Survey.xlsx"_ file, edit the data source path in the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_ file to change it to your preferred location

- Once you open the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_ the file will prompt to update the data source _(this will depend on the excel version you are running)_
